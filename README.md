## Lab 1A
Obtaining Linux on your PC â€“ Install Ubuntu using VMware

Downloading of ubuntu ISO file

Creating a new virtual machine in VMware

Configuration of VM settings and network issues (NAT instead of bridged)

Understanding Basic commands for Linux 

pwd (Print Working Directory) tells me which directory I am located (/home/user)

I created a new directory called Test1 using mkdir (mkdir Test1)

Next is did was ls which gives the listings of the current directory

After creating Test1 I used ls to check if it was created and yes it was there

Next command I used was cd which allows us to enter to that directory. I wanted to create a text file in Test1, so first I had to enter to Test1 directory and create a .txt file and use ls to check the contents of Test1 to see if a .txt file was created.

cd Test1 (going into Test1 directory)

touch myfile.txt (creating the text file in Test1 directory)

ls (Checking if I see myfile.txt in Test1 directory)

Now I wanted to edit my text file give it some words so I used nano myfile.txt and edited the file and enter some texts "Hello World!)

Saved the file

ls again to check the if txt file is still there in Test1

Next I did was copy and paste the txt file to Documents directory using cp

cd .. (is to exit the current directory and go backwards)

copy the txt file and move to Documents but first I had to tell how to move it so I used the pwd earlier on to show that I was in /home/user

Now we use cp myfile.txt /home/user/Documents

After that I used ls to check and everything was there

Used rm (to remove the txt file afterwards)

Used rmdir (to remove the Test1 directory)

Once again ls to double confirm everything also manually check the file tab.
